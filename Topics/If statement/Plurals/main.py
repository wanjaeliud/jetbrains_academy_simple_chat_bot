# Alex wrote a program that reads a number and a word from the input to create
# phrases like "3 cats" and "1 dog". Unfortunately, the condition for plural
# nouns is currently missing. Alex doesn't know how to use if statements,
# but you do. Help Alex complete this program.
#
# The plural form of a word generally ends with s. All numbers, apart from 1,
# expect the plural form after them, even zero: "0 birds".
#
# Words that form their plural not by adding s, will NOT appear in the tests.

number = int(input())
word = input()

# write a condition for plurals
if number == 0 or number > 1:
    print(number, f'{word}s')
else:
    print(number, word)
